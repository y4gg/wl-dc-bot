   - Use `/setup roles` to configure admin/support roles
   - Use `/setup ticketchannel` to send the Create Ticket button

   - Ticket channel is created with proper permissions

3. **Support Process**
   - Support staff claims ticket with `/claim`

   - Optionally add other users with `/adduser`

4. **Close Ticket**
   - Use `/close` to close ticket

## Data Storage

Data is stored in separate files for better security:

- `settings.json` - Bot configuration (can be committed to git)
  - Category, channel, and message IDs
  - Ticket tags
  - Admin and support roles
  - Auto-close settings
  - User close permissions

- `data/tickets.json` - Ticket data (local only, not in git)
  - Active tickets
  - Ticket transcripts metadata

Transcript files are saved in `data/transcripts/` directory (local only, not in git).

### Auto-close not working
- Check bot has sufficient permissions
- Verify `data/tickets.json` is being saved properly (check file write permissions)
- Check console for error messages

## Development

- TypeScript for type safety
- Bun for fast development and runtime
